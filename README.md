# Jacobian SAEs
The goal of this paper is to create something similar to SAEs but which optimizes for _sparsity of computation_ rather than merely sparsity of internal representations.

This is an ongoing project and is still under development.

## Credit
The code base started off as a fork of the excellent [SAELens](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens/tree/main), and a lot of credit goes to them for giving me such a great starting point.
